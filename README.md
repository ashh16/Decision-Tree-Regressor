# Decision Tree Regressor
A Decision Tree Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous target variable. Decision Trees work by recursively partitioning the input space into regions and assigning a constant value to each region as the prediction. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how a Decision Tree Regressor works:

## 1) Data Preparation:

•	Gather your dataset, which should include a set of features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable).

•	Split your dataset into two parts: a training set and a testing set. The training set will be used to train the Decision Tree, and the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.


## 2) Decision Tree Initialization:

•	Start with the entire dataset (training set).

•	Calculate a measure of impurity for this dataset. Common impurity measures include Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).


## 3) Selecting the Best Split:

•	For each feature, consider all possible split points (thresholds).

•	Calculate the impurity of the resulting two subsets (the data points that are less than the threshold and those greater than or equal to the threshold).


•	Choose the split that reduces impurity the most. This reduction in impurity is typically measured using the decrease in MSE or MAE.

•	Repeat this process for all features to find the best feature and threshold for the split.


## 4) Split the Data:

•	Once the best split is found, partition the dataset into two subsets based on the selected feature and threshold. One subset will contain data points that satisfy the condition (e.g., feature < threshold), and the other subset will contain data points that do not satisfy the condition.

## 5) Recursive Process:

•	Now, you have two smaller datasets, one on each side of the split. Repeat steps 2-4 for each of these subsets.

•	Continue this recursive process until a stopping condition is met. Common stopping conditions include a maximum depth for the tree, a minimum number of samples in a leaf node, or a minimum impurity threshold.


## 6) Assign Values to Leaf Nodes:

•	When a stopping condition is met for a subset, create a leaf node.

•	The value assigned to a leaf node is typically the mean (for MSE) or median (for MAE) of the target values in that leaf's dataset.


## 7) Prediction:

•	To make predictions on new data, traverse the Decision Tree by following the splits based on the feature values of the new data until you reach a leaf node.

•	The prediction for the new data point is the value assigned to the leaf node.

## 8) Model Evaluation:

•	After training, use the testing set to evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as MSE, MAE, or R-squared.

## 9) Hyperparameter Tuning:

•	Experiment with different hyperparameters of the Decision Tree Regressor, such as the maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf, or the splitting criterion (MSE, MAE, etc.), to optimize the model's performance.

## 10) Deployment:

•	Once you are satisfied with the model's performance, you can deploy it for making predictions on new, unseen data.

Remember that Decision Trees are prone to overfitting if not properly pruned or if the depth is too large. Techniques like pruning or using ensemble methods like Random Forests can help mitigate this issue.
